## About Me
Since I was little, my dream was to work as a game developer for Supercell, the maker of the very popular and addicting game, Clash of Clans. When I was 13, after I saw the instant success of Flappy Bird, I made it my life's mission to study computer science so that one day, I could create my own app.

### Cool tech things I've done
- Contributed to an [open-source platform](https://github.com/webaverse/xrpackage) for distributed in-browser VR/AR applications using Three.js, WebGL, and Node.js.
- Created a [web application](https://master.d2ezegqjichq73.amplifyapp.com/) for Black Lives Matter live event updates, an image anonymizer tool, and resources, created using Amazon Amplify, n8n (open source workflow automation tool), React, and GCP.
- Scraped the 2020 U.S. Presidential Candidates' tweets using Tweepy and created a [web application](https://github.com/vkong6019/scrapetheprez) to compare candidates' tweets on political keywords.
- Researched and experimented with an [encryption scheme](https://github.com/indefinities/Homo-Encrypt-Facebook-Data) for securely enabling encrypted Facebook personal data to be used by third parties.
- Attended 8 hackathons to date across the U.S., winning awards at [TechTogether Boston](https://devpost.com/software/miraimessage) and [YHack](https://devpost.com/software/garbadoor).
