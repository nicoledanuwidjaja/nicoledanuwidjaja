# HELLO! üèéÔ∏èüèéÔ∏èüèéÔ∏è 
I'm a software engineer at [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) working on scaling, maintaining, and improving our [distributions metrics platform](https://docs.datadoghq.com/metrics/distributions/). My current tech interests lie in breaking large-scale distributed systems, building responsive mobile app trackers, and fiddling with IoT devices.

Previously, I was working on [APM Go Tracer](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/setup_overview/setup/go/?tab=containers) and [Agent](https://docs.datadoghq.com/agent/). Aspiring software engineer, entrepreneur, and thinker. I‚Äôve also interned at [WHOOP](http://whoop.com/), [Zwift](https://zwift.com/), [Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/), and was a founding engineer at [Pareto](http://hellopareto.com/).
